Abstract

An online shopping system that allows a customer to submit online orders for items and/or services from a store that aids online customers. The online shopping system presents an online display of items and orders that are placed. The system accepts the customer's proposal of a purchase order for the item. Hence, the customer can go online and make alterations to the order. Also, available service windows are offered to the customer as a function of customer chosen order and service types. When ordering goods,several shopping systems provide a virtual shopping cart for containing items selected for purchase. Successive items chosen for purchase are put into the virtual shopping cart until a customer finishes their shopping trip. Virtual shopping carts may be observed at any time, and their contents can be  modified or deleted accordingly by the user. Once the customer plans to submit an order purchased, the customer may print the objects of the virtual shopping basket so as  to get a hard copy record of the transaction performed.
